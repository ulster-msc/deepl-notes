Question 2 — List layers in order (Sequential model)

- Final answer (from first to last):
  1) Dense, 2) Dropout, 3) Dense, 4) Dense

Explanation
- The code calls `model.add` four times in sequence: a 64‑unit Dense (ReLU), a `Dropout(0.5)`, a 32‑unit Dense (ReLU), and finally a 1‑unit Dense (Sigmoid).
