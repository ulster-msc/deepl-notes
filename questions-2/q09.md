Question 9 — Convolution with a 3×3 vertical edge kernel

- Final answer: **8** (absolute value of convolution result)

Detailed explanation

**Understanding Convolution and Edge Detection:**

Convolution is the fundamental operation in CNNs. The kernel (also called filter) slides over the input, computing element-wise products and summing them. Certain kernels detect specific features like edges.

**Step 1: Extract the 3×3 region**

From the screenshot, the highlighted (yellow) region in rows 1-3, columns 1-3 contains:

```
5  0  8
3  1  6
0  2  2
```

**Step 2: Identify the kernel**

The given kernel is a **vertical edge detector**:

```
 1  0  -1
 1  0  -1
 1  0  -1
```

**Why this detects vertical edges:**
- Left column: +1 (responds to bright pixels on the left)
- Middle column: 0 (ignores center)
- Right column: -1 (responds to dark pixels on the right)
- Result: strong response where intensity changes left → right (vertical edges)

**Step 3: Perform convolution (element-wise multiply and sum)**

Align the kernel with the region and multiply corresponding elements:

```
Region:          Kernel:        Element-wise product:
5  0  8      ×   1  0  -1   =   5×1   0×0   8×(-1)
3  1  6          1  0  -1       3×1   1×0   6×(-1)
0  2  2          1  0  -1       0×1   2×0   2×(-1)
```

**Calculate each product:**
- Row 1: 5×1 = 5,   0×0 = 0,   8×(-1) = -8
- Row 2: 3×1 = 3,   1×0 = 0,   6×(-1) = -6
- Row 3: 0×1 = 0,   2×0 = 0,   2×(-1) = -2

**Sum all products:**
```
Convolution result = 5 + 0 + (-8) + 3 + 0 + (-6) + 0 + 0 + (-2)
                   = 5 - 8 + 3 - 6 - 2
                   = (5 + 3) - (8 + 6 + 2)
                   = 8 - 16
                   = -8
```

**Step 4: Take absolute value**

The question asks for the **absolute value**:
```
|−8| = 8
```

**Final answer: 8**

**Interpretation:**
- The negative result (-8) indicates the region has brighter pixels on the right than the left
- The magnitude (8) indicates a moderate edge strength
- Vertical edge detectors are commonly used in CNNs for feature extraction
