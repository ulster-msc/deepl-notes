Question 13 — Keras model development lifecycle (fill step 3 and 4)

- Final answers (in order):
  3) Compile the model
  4) Fit/train the model

Explanation
- After defining the architecture, Keras requires a `compile(...)` step to set the optimizer/loss, then `fit(...)` to train on data. After training, the model can be used to predict on new data.
