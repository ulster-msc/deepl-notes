Question 5 — Match ANN terms to definitions

- Final matches (definitions written explicitly):
  - Epoch: one full pass over the entire training dataset.
  - Bias: a trainable offset added to the weighted sum before activation.
  - Loss Function: a measure of prediction error to be minimized (objective).
  - Optimizer: the algorithm that updates weights/biases using gradients (e.g., SGD/Adam).
  - Hidden Layer: any layer between the input and output layers.
