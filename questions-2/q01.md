Question 1 — Perceptron weighted sum and activation

- Final answers
  - z term: + b (bias)
  - Activation: step (threshold) function

Explanation
- In a perceptron the neuron forms a linear combination of inputs and weights and adds a bias: z = \sum_i w_i x_i + b. The output is then obtained by applying a threshold/step activation to z (classical perceptron rule).
