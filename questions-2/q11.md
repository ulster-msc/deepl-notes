Question 11 — 3×3 pooling over the highlighted region

Detailed explanation

**Understanding the problem:**

The question provides a 6×6 input feature map and asks us to apply both **Max Pooling** and **Average Pooling** over a 3×3 highlighted region.

**Key note:** The question mentions "stride = 0" which is unusual (stride is typically ≥1). Given that only one highlighted window is shown and single scalar answers are requested, we interpret this as computing pooling for the one shown 3×3 region.

**Step 1: Extract the highlighted 3×3 region**

From the screenshot, the highlighted (yellow/tan) region contains:

```
2  2  9
2  1  3
1  1  3
```

**Step 2: Apply Max Pooling**

**Definition:** Max pooling selects the **maximum value** from the pooling window.

**Process:**
- List all 9 values: {2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3}
- Identify the maximum: max{2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3} = **9**

**Max Pooling Result: 9**

**Why max pooling?**
- Preserves the strongest activation/feature
- Provides translation invariance
- Most commonly used in CNNs
- Helps detect whether a feature is present anywhere in the region

**Step 3: Apply Average Pooling**

**Definition:** Average pooling computes the **mean** of all values in the pooling window.

**Process:**
1. Sum all values:
   - Row 1: 2 + 2 + 9 = 13
   - Row 2: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6
   - Row 3: 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
   - **Total sum: 13 + 6 + 5 = 24**

2. Count elements: 3 × 3 = 9

3. Calculate average: 24 / 9 = 2.666...

4. Round to 2 decimal places: **2.67**

**Average Pooling Result: 2.67**

**Why average pooling?**
- Smoother downsampling
- Preserves overall information from the region
- Less commonly used than max pooling in modern CNNs
- Can be useful when all features matter, not just the strongest

**Final Answers:**
- **Max Pooling: 9**
- **Average Pooling: 2.67**
