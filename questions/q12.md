Question 12 — MLP output size

- Final fill: 1

Detailed explanation
- The prompt states the model has one hidden layer with 10 nodes and an output layer with a Sigmoid activation. Sigmoid is standard for binary classification, producing a probability in [0,1]. A single output unit is therefore appropriate.
- If the task had K>2 classes, we would typically use `Dense(K, activation='softmax')` instead.
