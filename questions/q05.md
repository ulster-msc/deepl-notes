Question 5 — Compile and fit parameters (Keras Sequential)

Completed lines
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy')

model.fit(Train_x, Train_y,
          epochs=100,
          batch_size=32)
```

Detailed explanation
- The architecture ends with `Dense(10)` (no activation given in the snippet). In typical multi‑class classification with 10 classes you would add `activation='softmax'` to that last Dense and use `categorical_crossentropy` (if labels are one‑hot) or `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` (if labels are integers). The question only asks to fill compile/fit arguments, so we use the common pairing `adam` + `categorical_crossentropy`.
- Training hyperparameters are not fixed by the prompt; 100 epochs and batch size 32 are standard, reasonable defaults for small tabular/educational examples.
