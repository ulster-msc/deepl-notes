Question 3 — Keras Functional API model()

- Final fill: **Model(inputs=x_in, outputs=x_out)**

Detailed explanation

**Understanding the Keras Functional API:**

Unlike the Sequential API (which stacks layers linearly), the Functional API builds models by explicitly defining the computational graph using tensor operations. This requires specifying both the starting point (inputs) and ending point (outputs).

**Step-by-step analysis of the code:**

1. **Input layer creation:**
   ```python
   x_in = Input(shape=(8,))
   ```
   - Creates an input placeholder that expects 8-dimensional feature vectors
   - `x_in` is a tensor object representing the input

2. **First hidden layer:**
   ```python
   x = Dense(10)(x_in)
   ```
   - Creates a Dense layer with 10 neurons
   - The layer is called on `x_in`, connecting it to the input
   - `x` is now a tensor representing the output of this layer

3. **Output layer:**
   ```python
   x_out = Dense(3)(x)
   ```
   - Creates a Dense layer with 3 neurons (likely 3-class classification)
   - The layer is called on `x`, connecting it to the previous layer
   - `x_out` is a tensor representing the final output

4. **Model creation:**
   ```python
   model = Model(inputs=x_in, outputs=x_out)
   ```
   - The `Model` constructor requires two arguments:
     - **inputs**: The starting tensor(s) of the computational graph
     - **outputs**: The ending tensor(s) of the computational graph
   - Keras traces the graph backwards from `x_out` to `x_in` to determine all layers and connections

**Why both inputs and outputs are needed:**
- **inputs=x_in**: Tells Keras where data enters the model
- **outputs=x_out**: Tells Keras what the model should output
- Keras automatically infers all intermediate layers and connections by tracing the tensor graph

**Complete architecture:**
Input(8) → Dense(10) → Dense(3) → Output
