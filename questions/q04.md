Question 4 — Convolution between two same‑size matrices (elementwise product then sum)

- Final answer: **29**

Detailed explanation

**Understanding the operation:**

The formula shown in the question describes a convolution between two 2×2 matrices as:
```
[a  b] * [w  x] = aw + bx + ey + fz
[e  f]   [y  z]
```

This is an element-wise multiplication followed by summation (also called the Frobenius inner product or correlation operation).

**Step-by-step calculation:**

Given:
- Matrix A = [[2, 3], [3, 4]]
- Matrix B = [[1, 2], [3, 3]]

**Step 1: Map the values to the formula notation**
```
Matrix A:        Matrix B:
[2  3]          [1  2]
[3  4]          [3  3]

a = 2           w = 1
b = 3           x = 2
e = 3           y = 3
f = 4           z = 3
```

**Step 2: Apply the formula (element-wise multiplication)**
- a × w = 2 × 1 = 2
- b × x = 3 × 2 = 6
- e × y = 3 × 3 = 9
- f × z = 4 × 3 = 12

**Step 3: Sum all products**
Total = 2 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 29

**Verification with visual mapping:**
```
[2  3]  ⊙  [1  2]  =  [2×1  3×2]  =  [2   6]
[3  4]     [3  3]     [3×3  4×3]     [9  12]

Sum of all elements = 2 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 29
```

Where ⊙ denotes element-wise (Hadamard) product.

Python check
```python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[2, 3],[3, 4]])
B = np.array([[1, 2],[3, 3]])
print(np.sum(A*B))  # 29
```

Final answer
- 29
